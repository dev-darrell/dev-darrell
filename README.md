### Hi there 👋🏽👋🏽

I'm Adebowale Medeyinlo, a certified junior Android developer.

I'm currently learning more about _Algorithms & Data structures_, _Custom Views_ and _Dependency Injection._ 
Also, with Jetpack Compose in beta now, it's among the things on top of my list of what to learn.

I'll be glad to collaborate on cool projects where I can use my skills and improve on new ones!

You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adnahcodes)

Thanks for checking out my profile!!
