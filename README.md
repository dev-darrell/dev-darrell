### Hi there 👋🏽👋🏽

I'm Adebowale Medeyinlo, a certified Android developer.
I work as a freelancer helping schools and training institutes build apps to improve their processes.

Right now, I'm taking a deep dive _Algorithms & Data structures_, _Custom Views_ and _Dependency Injection._ 
Jetpack Compose is also one of the top things on my list of what to learn.

I'll be glad to work on cool projects with you.
Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://LinkedIn.com/in/adnah-medeyinlo) and let's connect!

Thanks for checking out my profile!!
